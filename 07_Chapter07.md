# Chapter 7: Conclusion - The Robin Hood of Mykonos

On our final day in Mykonos, we stumbled upon a stranger lurking in the shadows of a back alley. It was a woman who introduced herself as Robin Hood and claimed to be a local hero. She told us of her mission to help the local community and support the small businesses that were struggling to compete with larger corporations.

Moved by her passion for the island, we decided to follow Robin Hood on her mission. Our first stop was at one of the best spas in Mykonos. Robin Hood explained that even though it may seem glamorous to indulge in luxury treatments, it was important to support locally owned and operated businesses. As we enjoyed our massages and facials, we felt good knowing that our money was going towards the greater good of the community.

Next, we embarked on a shopping tour of Mykonos. Robin Hood led us to the most exclusive stores and boutiques that were run by local entrepreneurs. She informed us that the influx of chain stores had been driving out local businesses, and it was up to the people to support their own community.

As the sun began to set, we made our way to one of the most popular beach clubs in Mykonos. Robin Hood showed us how we could be a part of the nightlife scene without supporting the large corporations that were taking over the island. We sipped on cocktails made with locally sourced ingredients and danced the night away at the club owned by special guest Chef Nobu Matsuhisa.

The next day, we headed out on an adventure seeking the thrill of parasailing and jet skiing. Robin Hood showed us a side of Mykonos that was untouched by large corporations and chains. We explored the secluded beaches and connected with the local people who were still very much in touch with the island's heritage.

Finally, we savored the delicious food at our last dinner in Mykonos. Robin Hood informed us of the importance of supporting local restaurants that used fresh, locally sourced ingredients. She even organized a special meal at Matsuhisa Mykonos, the restaurant owned by Chef Nobu Matsuhisa, who is known for his commitment to sustainability.

As we said our goodbyes to Robin Hood, we realized that the true luxury of Mykonos lay not only in the glamour and excitement, but also in the ability to connect with the community and make a difference. We left the island with a newfound respect for the local businesses and the people who called Mykonos their home.
In conclusion, our experience with the Robin Hood of Mykonos taught us that luxury living could also be sustainable, ethical and community-oriented. With her guidance, we explored the island from a different perspective, appreciating the hidden gems that were often overshadowed by the large corporations competing for tourist dollars. From the best spas and luxury shopping to adventure-seeking itineraries and dining at the best restaurants, she showed us how to experience the island without neglecting the local community. It was an experience we'll never forget, and one that we hope to replicate in other travels, by making conscious choices that support the local people and businesses.
